\title{Plot function for true and estimated continuous, discrete and combined migratory connectivity}
\usage{
plotCombM(
  markRecaptureObject,

  trueContinuous = TRUE,
  trueDiscrete = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{markRecaptureObject}{object of class markRecaptureObject}

\item{optimizationObject}{object of class optimizationObject}

\item{pdf}{logical, plot as pdf?, defaults to FALSE}

\item{fileName}{character string, only if pdf is TRUE, defaults to current time}

\item{trueContinuous}{logical, plot true continuous migratory connectivity}

\item{trueDiscrete}{logical, plot true discrete migratory connectivity}

\item{estContinuous}{logical, plot estimated continuous migratory connectivity}

\item{estDiscrete}{logical, plot estimated discrete migratory connectivity}

\item{estCombined}{logical, plot estimated combined migratory connectivity}
}
\description{
This function plots (in 1D) combinations of true and estimated migratory connectivity values. It is possible to chose between continuous, discrete and combined estimates.
