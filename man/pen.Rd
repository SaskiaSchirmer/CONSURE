\title{penalization function for combined parameter estimate}
\usage{
pen(beta, rawSpline, m, b, lambda, split, A, prop, dim, res, inside, normalize)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta}{parameter of the b-spline, values are to be optimized}

\item{rawSpline}{raw spline, value of initSpline()}

\item{m}{vector of continuous migratory connectivity estimates}

\item{b}{name of breeding area}

\item{lambda}{weights for different penalization terms}

\item{split}{vector of length of y which defines the affiliation to a
discrete wintering area}

\item{A}{squared second derivative of B-spline}

\item{prop}{vector of proportions of individuals going to discrete wintering
areas (discrete estimate or expected value for migratory
connectivity)}

\item{dim}{numeric, spatial dimension}

\item{res}{numeric, spatial resolution}

\item{inside}{specifies if a cell of the gridded window is inside the window
of the data or not. Vector of logicals.}

\item{normalize}{numeric, normalizes the discretized integralt. Equals to
the spatial resolution in one-dimensional space and to the
product of the spatial resolutions in two-dimensional space.}
}
\value{
function depending on bspline parameters, which returns the sum of
        quadratic distances to continuous and discrete migratory connectivity
        and smoothness
}
\description{
This function defines the penalization term for the combined estimation
approach. It can be used to jointly optimize distance to continuous migratory
connectivity estimates gained by estM, discrete migratory connectivity
estimates and maximize smoothness.
